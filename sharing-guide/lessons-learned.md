# Lessons Learned

## Business Use Case Proposal Lessons Learned

The topics addressed in the CalHHS Data-Sharing Guidebook were identified by conducting discovery sessions with a sample of the agency’s departments. The lessons learned focus on data sharing via a Business Use Case Proposal (BUCP) but apply to other sharing agreements as well. The lessons learned provided by discovery session participants are provided in this section and address the following categories:

* [BUCP Creation](lessons-learned.md#bucp-creation)
* [Data Requests](lessons-learned.md#data-requests)
* [Statutory and Legal](lessons-learned.md#statutory-and-legal)
* [Security Reviews](lessons-learned.md#security-reviews)
* [Data Fulfillment](lessons-learned.md#data-fulfillment)
* [BUCP Process Improvement](lessons-learned.md#bucp-process-improvement-lessons-learned)

The table below summarizes the lessons learned provided by discovery session participants and the benefits they provide to data sharing. Where applicable, the lessons learned reference the Data-Sharing Plays provided later in the Guidebook.

|             If a statutory consideration impacts data sharing, ask the data provider for their concerns and references to the impacting statute(s).            | <p>Specific information allows data requestor and provider teams to work together more effectively.<br></p><p>Your legal team’s interpretation may also help your business, data, and technical teams identify alternate solutions. For example, when the data provider cannot share data on individual program participants, an alternative solution may be for the data-provider to combine the target datasets and provide aggregated data.</p> |

| BUCP processes, tools, and standard content may have been developed organically at the program level and easily accessible. Create a centralized BUCP repository. | <p>A centralized BUCP repository distributes the data-sharing assets developed by individual programs across your department. The repository also provides a library of previous BUCPs for reference and potential content reuse.<br><br>In the subsequent section, <em>Data- Sharing Plays, Play 1: Establish Data-Sharing Metrics and BUCP Tracking,</em> describes creating a centralized BUCP repository.</p> |
