In the following section, we’ll provide a clear, step-by-step guide to the entire planning process, including everything you need to know about creating goals, determining a plan, and getting your data. It is our hope that you leave this section with a detailed and specific plan, and the confidence that you have the tools to carry out a successful project.

## Set Clear and Measurable Outcomes

Be sure that you are measuring success and thinking critically about what your success metrics will be. You must have clear and actionable goals that you want to achieve with your data project.

## Explore Shared Services Models

Don’t have access to the IT services you need? Maybe there is a shared service you can use with other Departments, or there are easier ways to get access to contemporary technologies. It’s also possible that you could iteratively re-engineer your existing IT infrastructure to gradually meet emerging needs.
