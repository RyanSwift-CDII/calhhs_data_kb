## Data Visualization (Beginner to Advanced)

If you just need a quick chart or table, check out these online tools — they are simpler to use than the advanced data visualization guides and may be more appropriate for your specific project:

* Google Charts (interactive charts & simple data tools)
* DataWrapper (charts, tables, and maps)
* Infogram (beginner-friendly, collaborative, focuses on design thinking principles)

More sophisticated guides are listed below:

Beginner: databasic.io – A suite of easy-to-use web tools for beginners that introduce concepts of working with data. These simple tools make it easy to work with data in fun ways, so you can learn how to find great stories to tell. Beginner: This article summarizing general Data Visualization strategies and common methods used in different professions and sectors. Beginner: Tableau’s Data Visualization for Beginners: a Definition & Learning Guide with helpful examples Beginner: This Step-by-Step Guide to Data Visualization and Design written for beginners Beginner-Intermediate: Kaggle’s Data Visualization Course teaches you how to implement some more basic, powerful data visualization techniques (line charts, scatter plots, and distributions) and how to choose the right one. Intermediate:Vega – A visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON format and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG. Intermediate-Advanced: The Data Visualization Catalogue has a comprehensive list of charts that are separated by what data visualization function they employ. Advanced: D3.js – Data-Driven Documents D3 is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. All levels: Coursera often has free online Data Visualization Courses — check to see if one is available!

## Presenting your Data

### Color Contrast Grid

Use the [Color Contrast Grid](http://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) tool to test many foreground and background color combos for compliance with WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast.

### Hemingway

Use a word editing app like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to improve the readability of your writing. Hemingway will highlight lengthy or run-on sentences, remove overly dense writing, offer alternatives for weak adverbs and phrases as well as poor formatting choices.

### Visualize Your Story

Visualize your story with a storyboard (see MIT’s [guide](https://datatherapy.org/activities/activity-finding-a-story-in-data/) to finding a story in your data)
