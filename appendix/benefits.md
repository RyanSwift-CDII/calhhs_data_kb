# Data Sharing Benefits

## Benefits

### Benefits to Your Department from Executing the Plays

Cataloging your department's datasets and capturing their metadata benefits external data recipients and your organization's analytics, application enhancement, and information security teams. You can use this section during the execution of the Plays to:

* Secure executive support by showing internal benefits and bolstering the business case for the data cataloging effort.
* Gain buy-in from the internal teams that are needed to support the effort by demonstrating direct benefit to their efforts.
* Support the business case for the acquisition of data management tools.

### Benefits for Internal Cross-Program Data-Sharing

The Data-Sharing Plays provides benefits for internal data-sharing between your department’s programs. Your data catalog creates awareness across your department’s programs of available data and points of contact to coordinate data-sharing agreements.

Like external data-sharing, providing data between programs within your department may require agreements and security approvals. The detailed metadata created by executing the Plays provides detailed security classifications for compliance and verification of security controls. Participation by your department’s information security team in classifying data also builds familiarity and expedites security reviews.

Additionally, data recipients from other programs may not be familiar with your data. The metadata catalog and business glossary created by executing the Plays foster understanding and the ability to accurately use data from other programs.

### Department Analytics Benefits

Your department's report and analytics creation efforts benefit from improved and comprehensive metadata by:

* Reduce Report Development Time: The inventory of data elements and their definitions allow your staff to create reports/analytics more quickly by:
  * Avoiding time spent on researching data element meaning.
  * Easy access to an inventory of your department's data.
* Providing support materials to explain report/analytics methodologies.
* Reduce New Staff Ramp-Up Time: Without data architecture artifacts, including your data catalog, staff must learn the meaning of data through research and with the support of existing staff. Access to the data catalog allows new staff to know your datasets in a self-service manner and without time spent sifting through documentation.
* Improve Report Accuracy: Access to the data element's meaning helps select the correct data during report/analytics creation. Additionally, a common understanding across report creators promotes alignment and accuracy across your department's reports.
* Improve Cross-Program Analysis: The understanding provided by your department's data catalog improves cross-program analysis by:
  * Helping data elements to link data across datasets (e.g., Identifiers).
  * Normalizing data by ensuring combined data has the same meaning.

Creating your data catalog also addresses State Administrative Manual (SAM) [5160.1](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/Resources/SAM/TOC/5100/5160-1) Item 4, requirements for Agencies to maintain an enterprise data inventory.

### Information Security Benefits

Having a detailed inventory of data elements and their data security classifications also benefits information security. The inventory of data elements and classifications provides the following:

* **State Information Management Manual (SIMM)** [**5305-A**](https://cdt.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SIMM-5305_A_2018-0108.pdf) **Requirements:** SIMM 5305-A, through a reference to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, requires that data maintained by the State of California maintain data classifications and other metadata.
* [State Information Management Manual (SIMM) 5305-A](https://cdt.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SIMM-5305_A_2018-0108.pdf) Requirements: SIMM 5305-A, through a reference to the [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/199/final), requires that data maintained by the State of California maintain data classifications and other metadata.
* Complete List of Applicable Security Requirements: The regulatory and department- level security requirements will vary by data element. Classifying each data element provides the information to establish the required data security controls. For example, some data elements may be subject to the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)/ Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Other data elements may contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII) subject to [California Senate Bill 1382 (SB1386 2003)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020SB1386).
* Input for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): An inventory of data elements is the foundation for establishing an RBAC based on least privilege. The inventory of data elements is used to map elements to user roles to implement data access that restricts access while allowing users access to data needed to work effectively. The inventory of data and its classifications is used to implement fine-grained controls such as record and attribute level security.
* Data De-identification: Data classifications and definitions are inputs for implementing data de-identification for datasets provided to internal users and external data recipients. Data de-identification eases data sharing by reducing risk. De-identified data may also expand the pool of internal staff to support analytics efforts through reduced security risk exposure.

### Application and Database Development Benefits <a href="#application_and_database_development_ben" id="application_and_database_development_ben"></a>

The data catalog established by executing the Plays also benefits your department's application development teams. The inventory of data improves the efficiency of system enhancement efforts by:

* Reduced Design and Development Time: Your enriched metadata minimizes the time to create new application and database system changes through:
  * Data Architecture Design: The data catalog allows design staff to create database specifications more quickly through a consolidated view of existing data elements. The data dictionary format also provides a mechanism to communicate database specifications to developers.
  * Data Element Identification: The data catalog improves the ability to create mappings between your system's data tier with user interface (UI) and data interfaces (e.g., External Interfaces). The data catalog reduces the time to create thorough technical specifications.
  * Data Element Re-use: The ability to quickly review data elements promotes re- use and accidental introduction of duplicate fields.
* Impact Analysis: When extended with mappings to UI and data interfaces, the data catalog improves the ability to identify the impacts of system change. Accurate impact analysis helps project planning efforts and reduces the risk of introducing unanticipated impacts.
* Level of Effort Estimates: The inventory from the data catalog provides an input to data-related level of effort estimates.
* Reduce New Staff Ramp-Up Time: Like reduced staff ramp-up time for analytics efforts, your application development teams benefit from the metadata catalog. Application and database developers can learn your data architecture more quickly using your metadata catalog.

### System Modernization Benefits <a href="#system_modernization_benefits" id="system_modernization_benefits"></a>

Creating a data catalog also helps future modernization efforts by providing inputs to current state analysis and data conversion. A comprehensive inventory of data elements and their descriptions is one input to assist with planning modernization efforts by:

* Provide a source of requirements for new data platforms.
* Improve the accuracy of level of effort estimations for the data-related portions of a new system, including:
  * New system data architecture design and implementation.
  * Data migration/conversion efforts.
* Document the data portions of the current state system to supplement procurement (e.g., Bidder's Library)

The data architecture artifacts created during the data cataloging effort support aspects of the [California Department of Technology (CDT) Project Approval Lifecycle (PAL)](https://cdt.ca.gov/project-delivery/how-do-i-start-a-project/) including:

* Mid-Level Requirements
* Data Conversion Plan
* Reference Architectures (Data Architecture)
