# Appendix A: Expert Determination Template

HIPAA covered entities in CalHHS must de-identify data in compliance with the HIPAA standard. Under the HIPAA standard, either Safe Harbor or Expert Determination must be used. If Expert Determination is used then the documentation of the review is essential. The following may serve as a template for this documentation with the reference to the CalHHS DDG to support the analysis documented.

Documentation of Expert Determination Template

Name of Report:

Reason for Data Release:

Identify why the data release does not meet Safe Harbor. For example:

The request does not meet the Safe Harbor standard because it includes counts by county (geographic area smaller than the state) or counts by month (which does not meet the criteria for dates). Therefore, the steps in the CalHHS DDG are being used to assess the tables.
