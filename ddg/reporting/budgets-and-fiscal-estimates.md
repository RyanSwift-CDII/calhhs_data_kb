# Budgets and Fiscal Estimates

Budget reporting may include both actuals and projected amounts. Projected amounts, although developed with models that are based on the historical actuals, reflect activities that have not yet occurred and, therefore, do not require an assessment for de-identification. Actual amounts do need to be assessed for de-identification. When the budgets reflect caseloads, but do not include personal characteristics of the individuals in the caseloads, then the budgets are reflecting data in the Providers and Health and Service Utilization Data circles of the Figure 2 Venn Diagram and do not need further assessment. However, if the actual amounts report caseloads based on personal characteristics, such as age, sex, race or ethnicity, then the budget reporting needs to be assessed for de-identification.
