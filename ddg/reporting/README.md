# Types of Reporting

CalHHS programs develop a wide range of information based on different types of data. This is reflected in the various categories shown on the entry page for the CalHHS Open Data Portal, which include:

* Diseases and Conditions
* Facilities and Services
* Healthcare
* Workforce
* Environment

Various types of reporting may or may not have a connection to personal characteristics that would create potential risk of identifying individuals.&#x20;
