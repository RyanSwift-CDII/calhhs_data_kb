# Survey Data

Survey data, often collected for research purposes, are collected differently than administrative data, and these differences should be considered in decisions about security, confidentiality, and data release.&#x20;

Administrative data sources (non-survey data) such as vital statistics (e.g., births and deaths), health care administrative data (e.g., Medi-Cal utilization; hospital discharges), reportable disease surveillance data (e.g., measles cases) contain data for all persons in the population with the specific characteristic or other data elements of interest. Most of the discussions in this document pertain to these types of data.

On the other hand, surveys (e.g., the California Health Interview Survey) are designed to take a sample of the ,population and collect data on characteristics of persons in the sample, with the intent of generalizing to gain knowledge suggestive of the whole population.

The sampling methodology developed for any given survey is generally developed to maximize the sample size with the available resources while making the sample as un- biased (representative) as possible. These sampling procedures that are a fundamental part of surveys generally change the key considerations for the protection of security and confidentiality and give an extra layer of masking which can decrease the risk of re-identification. Given the world of artificial intelligence, increased availability of data on social platforms, increased incidences of data hacking, and the passage of new laws on data sharing, there is a much higher risk to re-identify an individual when small numbers are released. Thus, the Publication Scoring Criteria should be used to assess the potential risk and the same Data De-Identification Guidelines should be applied to the survey data..

Also, it is in the context of surveys that issues of statistical reliability often ariseâ€”which are distinct from confidentially issues, but often arise in related discussions. We recommend that the estimates be considered statistically unreliable and suppressed if the denominator is based on fewer than 30 sample cases.

&#x20;

&#x20;A few national and state surveys have adopted various guidelines to de-identify their survey data and various thresholds for the reliability of sample sizes\[1]. If any state or national survey has not adopted its own guidelines to de-identify data and/or threshold of statistical reliability and if the survey is not included in the list of Appendix D, then the above mentioned CalHHS Data De-Identification Guidelines and threshold of 30 sample cases should be observed by the CalHHS departments.
