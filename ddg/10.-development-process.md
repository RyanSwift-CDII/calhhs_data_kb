# 10. Development Process

The CHHS Data Subcommittee requested the convening of the CHHS Data De- Identification Workgroup to develop the DDG.

The DDG Workgroup began with an orientation to the topic of data de-identification and presentations by the DHCS, OSHPD and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) regarding current practices and activities related to data de-identification. The DDG Workgroup used the Public Aggregate Reporting for DHCS Business Reports (PAR-DBR) as a starting point for initial drafts. The PAR-DBR had been developed between April and August, 2014 through a workgroup processes within DHCS with input and presentations from OSHPD, CDPH, and University of California, Los Angeles California Health Interview Survey. The PAR-DBR served as a basis for this document, including the literature review conducted as part of the development of the PAR-DBR.

The development process was designed to include an updated literature review, case examples and broad discussion among CHHS programs. Publishing data publicly is always a balance between the protection of confidentiality and the usability of the data.

The project timeline for the CHHS DDG Workgroup is below:
