# 2. Background

CalHHS implemented an agency-wide governance structure in October, 2014. The governance structure acts both in a decision-making and advisory capacity to Agency leadership and its departments and offices. Implementation of the governance framework supports information technology (IT) initiatives that are more tightly aligned with meeting business objectives, enhanced project prioritization and improved strategic IT investment decisions. The Executive Sponsor is the Undersecretary of CalHHS. The Advisory Council consists of representatives of senior leadership from departments and offices in the Agency. There are five subcommittees that report to the Advisory Council, which include the Portfolio, Procurement, Infrastructure, Risk Management and Data Subcommittees. The Data De-identification Workgroup was convened by the Data Subcommittee with representation from all departments and offices in CalHHS.

CalHHS is engaged in improving transparency and public reporting through the Open Data Portal. As described in the CalHHS Open Data Portal Handbook, not all data is suitable for use on the open data portal. Data is Publishable State Data if it meets one of the following criteria:

1. Data that are public by law such as via the [Public Records Act (PRA) ](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=GOV\&division=10.\&title=1.\&part=\&chapter=\&article=)or
2. The data are not prohibited from being released by any laws, regulations, policies, rules, rights, court order, or any other restriction.

Data shall not be released if it is restricted due to the HIPAA, state or federal law. Data tables may fall into one of [three categories](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]:

* Level One: Data tables that can be released to the public and published without restriction;
* Level Two: Data tables that have some level of restriction or sensitivity but currently can be made available to interested parties with a signed data use agreement; or
* Level Three: Level three data are restricted due to HIPAA, state or federal law. These data will NOT be accessible through the CalHHS Open Data Portal.

Data can change from being Level 3 to Level 1 if appropriate de-identification processes are employed. The CalHHS DDG described in this document will support departments and offices in the evaluation of data to determine whether it has been adequately de-identified so that it can be considered Level 1.
