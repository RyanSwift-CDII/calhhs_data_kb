# 1. Purpose

The California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHS) Data De-identification Guidelines (DDG) describes a procedure to be used by departments and offices in the CHHS to assess data for public release. As part of the document, specific actions that may be taken for each step in the procedure are described. These steps are intended to assist departments in assuring that data is de-identified for purposes of public release that meet the requirements of the California Information Practices Act1 (IPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act2 (HIPAA) to prevent the disclosure of personal information.

Additionally, the DDG support CHHS governance goals to reduce inconsistency of practices across departments, align standards used across departments, facilitate the release of useful data to the public, promote transparency of state government, and support other CHHS initiatives, such as the CHHS Open Data Portal.
