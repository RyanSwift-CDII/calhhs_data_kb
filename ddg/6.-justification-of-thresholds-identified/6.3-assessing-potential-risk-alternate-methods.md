# 6.3 Assessing Potential Risk – Alternate Methods

As noted in [Section 6.2](6.2-assessing-potential-risk-publication-scoring-criteria.md), the Publication Scoring Criteria is based on a framework that has been in use by the Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Center for Health Statistics. Various other methods have been used to assess risk and the presence of sensitive or small cells. Public health has a long history of public provision of data and many methods have been used. Some of those methods are highlighted here.

* [Ohio Department of Health published a Data Methodology Standards for Public Health Practice.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] This method is framed around the concept that a Disclosure Limitation Standard for tabulations of confidential Ohio Department of Health data shall be suppressed when the table denominator value minus the table numerator value is less than 10.
* [Washington State Department of Health published Guidelines for Working with Small Numbers ](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]that highlights many topics covered in the CalHHS DDG but also discusses the use of relative standard error (RSE) to assess reliability of data in addition to steps to take protect confidentiality.
* [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment published Guidelines for Working with Small Numbers](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] which also addresses many of the same topics.

The size of numerators and denominators vary in each of the documents above although the principles are consistent.
