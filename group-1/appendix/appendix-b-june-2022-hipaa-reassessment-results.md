# Appendix B: June 2022 HIPAA Reassessment Results

The [Center for Data Insights and Innovation](https://www.cdii.ca.gov/compliance-and-policy/health-information-entity-status-assessment/) (CDII) is authorized by state statute to coordinate and monitor Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance by all California State entities within the executive branch of government covered or impacted by HIPAA. To help ensure full compliance with HIPAA, CDII, conducted a reassessment with all State Departments in February and March 2022. \[1] Note the asterisk (\*) means the entity was added to the list per the 2022 review.

### Impacted Entities

Impacted by State and/or Federal regulations and laws related to health information privacy (non-HIPAA). Please reference California Health and Safety Code 1302023 (et seq.) CDII’s revised statutory authority includes oversight of organizations subject to non-HIPAA health information privacy laws and regulations. CDII is developing a compliance program for non-HIPAA entities to address these other State and Federal privacy laws not included in the current HIPAA compliance program. The organizations included in this list will be subject to that newly created program.
